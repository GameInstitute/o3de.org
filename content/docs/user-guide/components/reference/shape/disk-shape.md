The **Disk Shape** component creates a transparent circular surface that's oriented on the local Z axis. The dimensions of the disk can be edited with the **Radius** property. The Disk Shape component is not a mesh, but rather a helper geometry that can be used to define areas for area lights, spawners, shape gradients, audio, vegetation, PhysX, and any application that can utilize the Shape EBus. For more information on using Shape components, see [Shape components](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/shape/).

## DiskShapeComponentRequestsBus

Use the following request functions with the `DiskShapeComponentRequestsBus` EBus interface to communicate with Disk Shape components in your game.

| 方法名称 | 说明 | 参数 | 返回值 | 脚本化 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `GetDiskConfiguration` | Returns the configuration of the disk shape. | None | `DiskShapeConfig` object that contains the property `Radius`. | Yes |
|`GetRadius`| Returns the **Radius** of the disk shape. | None | Radius: Float | Yes |
|`SetRadius`| Sets the **Radius** of the disk shape. | Radius: Float | None | Yes |

Refer to [Shape component Ebus interface](./#shape-component-ebus-interface) for a description of functions that are available to all Shape components.
