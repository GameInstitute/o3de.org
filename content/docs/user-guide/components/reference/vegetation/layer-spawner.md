Use the **Vegetation Layer Spawner** component to define areas and rules for procedurally placing dynamic vegetation or other static meshes in your **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** level.

With the Vegetation Layer Spawner component, you can do the following:
- Create vegetation within a user-defined area at runtime.
- Configure layer settings to determine the depth or relative ordering in which to apply vegetation layers.
- Add [Vegetation Modifier](./../vegetation-modifiers/) and [Vegetation Filter](./../vegetation-filters/) components to add variation to placed vegetation.
- Use the [Vegetation Asset Weight Selector](vegetation-asset-weight-selector) component to determine which vegetation assets to place at a given location.
- Control the preview settings for attached components.
Inherit behavior from a parent [Vegetation Layer Blender](vegetation-layer-blender) component.

For information on how to use the Vegetation Layer Spawner, see [Dynamic vegetation](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/environment/vegetation/).

## Provider

[Vegetation Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/environment/vegetation/)

## Dependencies

Add the following required components when using the Vegetation Layer Spawner component:
- One of the following [Shape](./../shape/) components: [Axis Aligned Box](./../shape/axis-aligned-box-shape), [Box](./../shape/box-shape), [Capsule](./../shape/capsule-shape), [Compound](./../shape/compound-shape), [Cylinder](./../shape/cylinder-shape), [Disk](./../shape/disk-shape), [Polygon Prism](./../shape/polygon-prism-shape), [Quad](./../shape/quad-shape), [Shape Reference](./../shape/shape-reference), [Sphere](./../shape/sphere-shape), or [Tube](./../shape/tube-shape),  to define the vegetation's spawn area.
- A [Vegetation Asset List](vegetation-asset-list) or [Vegetation Asset List Combiner](vegetation-asset-list-combiner) component to list mesh assets, material assets, and other settings for the vegetation.

## Vegetation Layer Spawner properties

![Vegetation Layer Spawner component properties](/images/user-guide/components/reference/vegetation/vegetation-layer-spawner-component.png)

| 属性 | 说明 | 值 | 默认值 |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Override Preview Settings** | If `Enabled`, the **Preview Settings** properties determine the shape of the vegetation layer preview.  If `Disabled`, the bounds of the vegetation layer preview are set by the attached Shape component.  | Boolean | `Disabled` |
| **Pin Preview to Shape** | Sets an entity with a compatible shape component to use as the bounds of the vegetation layer preview if **Constrain to Shape** is `Enabled`.<br> <br>*This field is available only if **Override Preview Settings** is `Enabled`.* | EntityId | Current Entity |
| **Preview Position** | Sets the world location of the vegetation layer preview.<br> <br>*This field is available only if **Override Preview Settings** is `Enabled` and there is no entity selected in **Pin Preview to Shape**.* | Vector3: -Infinity to Infinity | X:`0.0`, Y:`0.0`, Z:`0.0` |
| **Preview Size** | Sets the dimensions of the vegetation layer preview if **Constrain to Shape** is `Disabled`.<br> <br>*This field is available only if **Override Preview Settings** is `Enabled`.* | Vector3: 0.0 to Infinity | X:`1.0`, Y:`1.0`, Z:`1.0` |
| **Constrain to Shape** | If `Enabled`, the vegetation layer preview will use the bounds of the entity selected in **Pin Preview to Shape**.<br> <br>*This field is available only if **Override Preview Settings** is `Enabled` and an entity is selected in **Pin Preview to Shape**.* | Boolean | `Disabled` |
| **Layer Priority** | Defines the high level order that vegetation areas are applied. | `Background` or `Foreground` | `Foreground` |
| **Sub Priority** | Defines the order that vegetation areas are applied within a layer. Larger numbers have a higher priority. | 0-10000 | `0` |
| **Inherit Behavior** | Allow shapes, modifiers and filters of a parent entity to affect this vegetation layer. | Boolean | `Enabled` |
| **Allow Empty Assets** | Allow unspecified assets to claim space and block other vegetation. | Boolean | `Enabled` |
| **Filter Stage** | Defines if filters are applied before or after modifiers. | `PreProcess` or `PostProcess` | `PreProcess` |

## VegetationSpawnerRequestBus
